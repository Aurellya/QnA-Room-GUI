# Q&A Room App
This is my first Java GUI! It only implements simple GUI and lambda functions. This is actually my school assignment. 

My Code is still bad! Please tolerate :)

## How Does This Program Work?
When conducting online workshop, there's always a room where participants can raise a question and host can answer it. 
This program provides q&a room where participant can put their questions in the box provided for participant and host can provide the answer through the provided host text area. 
Everytime a participant raises a question, there will be a popped panel which display the participant details and his/her question. 
There's also a clear button to clear the text area.
